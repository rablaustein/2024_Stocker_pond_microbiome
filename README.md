# Stocker_2024_pond_microbiome

Microbial communities in surface waters interact with environmental conditions and can influence changes in overall water quality. This study characterizes relationships between pond water microbiome diversity and water quality properties as a factor of sampling time and location in a model irrigation pond. Scripts and data that may be used to reproduce our analysis are provided here.
